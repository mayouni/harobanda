# OS-1 — the declared machine: language, plan, and PID 1

Ordered by the author on 2026-09-12: a distinct private repository for
the operating layer, designed and built in the Softanza style. This
section records what was done, what was measured, and what was found.
Newest section first, as stz's PROTOCOL.md.

## What was built

- **The machine language v0.1** (`declarative/machine/GRAMMAR.md`):
  five kinds — MACHINE, SERVICE, CAPABILITY, MOUNT, PIN — over the
  Grammar Commons' lexical form, every menu closed, the capability
  vocabulary stzlib's nine names verbatim. Judged by `fixtures.json`:
  8 accepts with structural expectations (identity, counts, service
  order, granted set, folded rationale), 32 rejects each carrying the
  fragment its refusal must contain. **40/40** after one correction
  (below). Pinned in `PINNING.md`.
- **The language declared in stzu** (`machine.stzu`) and judged by
  stz's own meta-court through `experiment/judge_machine_stzu.luau`,
  run by stz's runner from stz's directory: accepted first run —
  5 declarations, 4 forms, 0 expressions, 3 refusals, verbs
  CAPABILITY MACHINE MOUNT PIN SERVICE. Nothing forked.
- **The parser and checks** (`src/machine.zig`), **the plan**
  (`src/plan.zig`: console, implicit mounts, declared mounts, every
  capability granted or refused, pins, services in AFTER order with
  declaration order breaking ties), **the court** (`src/court.zig`),
  **the init** (`src/init.zig`: mounts by syscall with each result
  stated, services spawned as argv, PID 1's reaper with the three
  restart policies), and **the CLI** (`src/main.zig`), one static
  binary.
- **Two Linux targets by one flag** (`zig build cross`:
  x86_64-linux-musl and aarch64-linux-musl, static, ~3.4 MB unstripped).

## What was measured

- The court, probed in fresh processes with a mutated judge before its
  scoreboard was believed: a wrong count on A2 → red (`expected 99 got
  3`); a wrong fragment on R5 → red (`refused for the wrong reason`); a
  valid source posing as a reject → red (`accepted as machine 'hello'`).
  Three reds, each for its named reason, exit 1.
- The init on Windows: refuses by name (`init is a Linux act; this
  binary was built for windows`), exit 2.
- The init under WSL Ubuntu, x86_64 static binary run from the Windows
  mount (`experiment/wsl_boot.sh`, transcripts in `zig-out/wsl/`):
  1. from an ordinary pid without `--rehearse`: refused (`init is PID
     1's act; from pid N pass --rehearse`), exit 2;
  2. `--rehearse --turns 8`: the three mounts narrated and not executed,
     `once` exited 0 and stayed down, `flaky` exited 1 and was restarted
     five times then given up on, `steady` exited 0 and was restarted;
  3. **PID 1 for real** inside `unshare -Urpf --mount-proc`: pid 1,
     children pids 2–10, `proc` mounted (`done`), `sysfs` and `devtmpfs`
     refused by the kernel with `PERM` (a user namespace's rule, stated
     not hidden), the same reaper behaviour, ending `init would now halt
     the machine`.

## What was found (each a finding, not a footnote)

1. **The court's first conviction was of its own implementation.** R20
   expected the fragment `no declaration grants gpio`; the refusal said
   `needs gpio, which no declaration grants`. Same meaning, wrong
   words: the G8 gate fired exactly as designed. The message changed,
   the fixture did not.
2. **Zig 0.15's `File.Writer` writes positionally on a seekable
   stdout.** The first WSL transcript had run 2's refusal overwriting
   run 1's header and the shell's `exit` lines spliced mid-sentence:
   with stdout redirected to a regular file, the buffered writer began
   at offset 0 and `pwrite` over what the shell had already appended. A
   console is a character device and never shows it; a redirected
   transcript always does. Fixed by the streaming writer; recorded in
   CLAUDE.md as a trap.
3. **WSL output cannot be read through the PowerShell tool** (UTF-16
   decoding drops and splices lines), and a multi-command `bash -c`
   cannot be quoted through `wsl.exe` from PowerShell. The script
   writes files on the Windows mount; the session reads the files.
4. **Silence is refusal held up at the machine's altitude**: a service
   needing a capability no declaration mentions is refused at check
   time (R17), which is stzlib's `stzSystemScope` down-constrain law
   with the machine as the target.

## Named seams (stated, not hidden)

- The image (kernel + initramfs) and the QEMU boot: OS-2, blocked on a
  Linux build environment on this host.
- NETWORK as a kind; USER as a seat; restart backoff and budget; kernel-
  level enforcement of refused capabilities per service.
- The edge boot through MicroRing's substrate; the touch build.
- The name (`doc/PROVENANCE.md`).
