# OS-2 — the machine boots: a vendored kernel, an image derived from the plan, QEMU, the transcript judged

Ordered by the author on 2026-09-12 ("install qemu, gcc and make in WSL
and go for OS-2"), the same day as OS-1.

## What was built

- **`stzos image`** (`src/image.zig`): from a judged plan, three texts
  and no toolchain — `initramfs.list` in the kernel's own gen_init_cpio
  format (device nodes for PID 1, the mount points, `/stzos`, every
  program and file the services name taken from a staging root and
  REFUSED if absent, the declaration itself at `/etc/machine`),
  `kernel.fragment` (the kconfig the profile and the declared mounts
  need, merged over tinyconfig), `boot.cmd` (the QEMU line). Hosted and
  x86_64 only today; the rest refused by name.
- **The init's ending** (`src/init.zig`): PID 1 may not exit, so when
  every service has ended it calls `reboot(RESTART)`; under QEMU
  `-no-reboot` that closes the boot and the transcript. In a user
  namespace the kernel refuses it and the transcript says so.
- **The vendored kernel**: Linux 6.12.109 LTS, pinned by digest from
  kernel.org's own `sha256sums.asc` (`vendor/PIN.md`,
  `experiment/os2_kernel_fetch.sh`); the tarball stays out of git (over
  the file limit) and in `vendor/linux/`.
- **The imperative half** (`experiment/os2_image.sh`, WSL Ubuntu):
  stage, derive, tinyconfig + fragment + olddefconfig, `make -j2
  bzImage`, gen_init_cpio, QEMU with the serial console captured, then
  the judge: the transcript normalised (firmware banner and control
  bytes before PID 1's first line, CRs, pids → N) and diffed against
  `machines/qemu_hello.expected`.
- **stzr in the image**: stz's runtime cross-built from `D:\GitHub\stz`
  for x86_64-linux-musl (static, 776 KB, ReleaseSmall) with one flag —
  the first time the Softanza runtime ran on a machine the estate
  declared.

## What was measured

- Kernel: 496 options on, bzImage 1,217,536 bytes, **78 s wall** at two
  jobs (2m08 user) on WSL Ubuntu, gcc 15.2.
- Image: initramfs 4,232,704 bytes — stzos 3.4 MB unstripped, stzr
  776 KB, hello.luau, the machine file.
- Boot (QEMU 10.2, TCG, 256 MB): PID 1, `proc` `sysfs` `devtmpfs`
  `tmpfs` all mounted (`done` × 4 — the namespace refusals of OS-1 were
  the namespace's, not the init's), `self` (pid 15) printed the
  machine's own plan from inside the image, `hello` (pid 16) printed two
  lines from Luau under stzr, both exited 0, `reboot(RESTART)`, QEMU
  exit 0. **The transcript matches the pinned expectation line for
  line, 28 lines**, on the second run (the first run IS the pin, stated
  as such: there was no earlier oracle for a machine that had never
  booted).

## What was found

1. **Port 80 is blocked on this network**: apt over http timed out on
   every mirror address while https answered 200; the toolchain script
   switches Ubuntu's sources to https. `Acquire::ForceIPv4` was a wrong
   first diagnosis (the addresses shown were IPv6, the cause was the
   port).
2. **Extracting the kernel onto the Windows mount took longer than the
   600 s tool budget** and the build there would have been slower
   still; the pipeline extracts and builds in `$HOME` inside WSL, and
   the 1.6 GB stray extraction on the mount was removed.
3. **AFTER orders starts, not completions**: `hello` started after
   `self` was spawned, and the two outputs interleave under the
   scheduler. A completion/readiness seat is a fixture-first widening
   (`doc/ARCHITECTURE.md` §7).
4. **The Bash tool rewrites `/mnt/d/...` paths** handed to `wsl.exe`;
   WSL scripts are invoked from PowerShell.

## Named seams

- aarch64 image and real hardware (the Makeen box); block devices and
  persistent mounts (virtio-blk first); A/B slots; the bootloader.
- `make CC="zig cc"` for the kernel; a tarball mirror in the estate.
- The judge lives in a shell script today; folding it into `stzos
  judge <name>` (portable, like the court) is queued.

# OS-1 — the declared machine: language, plan, and PID 1

Ordered by the author on 2026-09-12: a distinct private repository for
the operating layer, designed and built in the Softanza style. This
section records what was done, what was measured, and what was found.
Newest section first, as stz's PROTOCOL.md.

## What was built

- **The machine language v0.1** (`declarative/machine/GRAMMAR.md`):
  five kinds — MACHINE, SERVICE, CAPABILITY, MOUNT, PIN — over the
  Grammar Commons' lexical form, every menu closed, the capability
  vocabulary stzlib's nine names verbatim. Judged by `fixtures.json`:
  8 accepts with structural expectations (identity, counts, service
  order, granted set, folded rationale), 32 rejects each carrying the
  fragment its refusal must contain. **40/40** after one correction
  (below). Pinned in `PINNING.md`.
- **The language declared in stzu** (`machine.stzu`) and judged by
  stz's own meta-court through `experiment/judge_machine_stzu.luau`,
  run by stz's runner from stz's directory: accepted first run —
  5 declarations, 4 forms, 0 expressions, 3 refusals, verbs
  CAPABILITY MACHINE MOUNT PIN SERVICE. Nothing forked.
- **The parser and checks** (`src/machine.zig`), **the plan**
  (`src/plan.zig`: console, implicit mounts, declared mounts, every
  capability granted or refused, pins, services in AFTER order with
  declaration order breaking ties), **the court** (`src/court.zig`),
  **the init** (`src/init.zig`: mounts by syscall with each result
  stated, services spawned as argv, PID 1's reaper with the three
  restart policies), and **the CLI** (`src/main.zig`), one static
  binary.
- **Two Linux targets by one flag** (`zig build cross`:
  x86_64-linux-musl and aarch64-linux-musl, static, ~3.4 MB unstripped).

## What was measured

- The court, probed in fresh processes with a mutated judge before its
  scoreboard was believed: a wrong count on A2 → red (`expected 99 got
  3`); a wrong fragment on R5 → red (`refused for the wrong reason`); a
  valid source posing as a reject → red (`accepted as machine 'hello'`).
  Three reds, each for its named reason, exit 1.
- The init on Windows: refuses by name (`init is a Linux act; this
  binary was built for windows`), exit 2.
- The init under WSL Ubuntu, x86_64 static binary run from the Windows
  mount (`experiment/wsl_boot.sh`, transcripts in `zig-out/wsl/`):
  1. from an ordinary pid without `--rehearse`: refused (`init is PID
     1's act; from pid N pass --rehearse`), exit 2;
  2. `--rehearse --turns 8`: the three mounts narrated and not executed,
     `once` exited 0 and stayed down, `flaky` exited 1 and was restarted
     five times then given up on, `steady` exited 0 and was restarted;
  3. **PID 1 for real** inside `unshare -Urpf --mount-proc`: pid 1,
     children pids 2–10, `proc` mounted (`done`), `sysfs` and `devtmpfs`
     refused by the kernel with `PERM` (a user namespace's rule, stated
     not hidden), the same reaper behaviour, ending `init would now halt
     the machine`.

## What was found (each a finding, not a footnote)

1. **The court's first conviction was of its own implementation.** R20
   expected the fragment `no declaration grants gpio`; the refusal said
   `needs gpio, which no declaration grants`. Same meaning, wrong
   words: the G8 gate fired exactly as designed. The message changed,
   the fixture did not.
2. **Zig 0.15's `File.Writer` writes positionally on a seekable
   stdout.** The first WSL transcript had run 2's refusal overwriting
   run 1's header and the shell's `exit` lines spliced mid-sentence:
   with stdout redirected to a regular file, the buffered writer began
   at offset 0 and `pwrite` over what the shell had already appended. A
   console is a character device and never shows it; a redirected
   transcript always does. Fixed by the streaming writer; recorded in
   CLAUDE.md as a trap.
3. **WSL output cannot be read through the PowerShell tool** (UTF-16
   decoding drops and splices lines), and a multi-command `bash -c`
   cannot be quoted through `wsl.exe` from PowerShell. The script
   writes files on the Windows mount; the session reads the files.
4. **Silence is refusal held up at the machine's altitude**: a service
   needing a capability no declaration mentions is refused at check
   time (R17), which is stzlib's `stzSystemScope` down-constrain law
   with the machine as the target.

## Named seams (stated, not hidden)

- The image (kernel + initramfs) and the QEMU boot: OS-2, blocked on a
  Linux build environment on this host.
- NETWORK as a kind; USER as a seat; restart backoff and budget; kernel-
  level enforcement of refused capabilities per service.
- The edge boot through MicroRing's substrate; the touch build.
- The name (`doc/PROVENANCE.md`).
